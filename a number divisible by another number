#using lambda func and filter to find the number divisible by another number

print("\n")
print(list(filter(lambda x: x % 5 == 0, range(1, 101))))

#filter is used to filter the elements from the list based on the condition given in the lambda function
#lambda function is used to define the function in one line
#range is used to generate the numbers from 1 to 100
